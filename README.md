Appcues Flutter Plugin allows you to integrate Appcues experiences into your Flutter apps for iOS and Android devices.

This Plugin package is a bridge between the native Appcues SDKs in a Flutter application which sends user properties and events to the Appcues API and retrieves and renders Appcues content based on those properties and events.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Android
Your application's `build.gradle` must have a `compileSdkVersion` of 33+ and `minSdkVersion` of 21+
```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21
    }
}
```
Your application's main Activity must derive from [`FlutterFragmentActivity`](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/android/FlutterFragmentActivity.html). Some Flutter application templates will default to `FlutterActivity`. Be sure to update this to `FlutterFragmentActivity` since this is necessary for Appcues experience content to render correctly in the application. Refer to our example application [`MainActivity.kt`](https://github.com/appcues/appcues-flutter-plugin/blob/main/example/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/appcues/samples/flutter/MainActivity.kt#L5) for reference. Without this update, you may see errors like the one below, when an Appcues experience attempts to render.
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: ViewTreeLifecycleOwner not found from DecorView@3edbb3[MainActivity]
```

#### iOS
Your application must target iOS 11+ to install the SDK, and iOS 13+ to render Appcues content. Update the iOS project xcodeproj to set the deployment target, if needed - typically in `iOS/Runner.xcodeproj`. In the application's `Podfile`, include at least this minimum version.
```rb
# Podfile
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

### Installation

Add `appcues_flutter` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  appcues_flutter: <latest_version>
```

Then, install the dependency by running `flutter pub get` from the terminal.

### One Time Setup

#### Initializing the SDK

An instance of the Appcues SDK should be initialized when your app launches.

```dart
import 'package:appcues_flutter/appcues_flutter.dart';

Appcues.initialize('APPCUES_ACCOUNT_ID', 'APPCUES_APPLICATION_ID');
```

Initializing the SDK requires you to provide two values, an Appcues account ID, and an Appcues mobile application ID. These values can be obtained from your [Appcues settings](https://studio.appcues.com/settings/account). Refer to the help documentation on [Registering your mobile app in Studio](https://docs.appcues.com/article/848-registering-your-mobile-app-in-studio) for more information.

#### Supporting Builder Preview and Screen Capture

During installation, follow the steps outlined in [Configuring the Appcues URL Scheme](https://github.com/appcues/appcues-flutter-plugin/blob/main/doc/URLSchemeConfiguring.md). This is necessary for the complete Appcues builder experience, supporting experience preview, screen capture and debugging.

### Identifying Users

In order to target content to the right users at the right time, you need to identify users and send Appcues data about them. A user is identified with a unique ID.

```dart
// Identify a user
Appcues.identify('my-user-id');
// Identify a user with property
Appcues.identify('my-user-id', {'Company': 'Appcues'});
```

### Tracking Screens and Events

Events are the ‚Äúactions‚Äù your users take in your application, which can be anything from clicking a certain button to viewing a specific screen. Once you‚Äôve installed and initialized the Appcues Flutter Plugin, you can start tracking screens and events using the following methods:

```dart
// Track event
Appcues.track('Sent Message');
// Track event with property
Appcues.track('Deleted Contact', {'ID': 123 });

// Track screen
Appcues.screen('Contact List');
// Track screen with property
Appcues.screen('Contact Details', {'Contact Reference': 'abc'});
```

### Anchored Tooltips

Anchored tooltips use element targeting to point directly at specific views in your application. For more information about how to configure your application's views for element targeting, refer to the [Anchored Tooltips Guide](https://github.com/appcues/appcues-flutter-plugin/blob/main/doc/AnchoredTooltips.md).
